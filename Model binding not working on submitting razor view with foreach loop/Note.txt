Why did model binding fail when we use foreach loop

The following is the generated HTML when we use a foreach loop. Notice the name attribute of the input 
elements. They are not unique and there is no integer indexer, so the model binder does not know it has 
to bind the values from these input elements to the list parameter on the controller action. This is the
reason the list parameter on the controller action is empty.
